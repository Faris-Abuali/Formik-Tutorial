# Formik Tutorial ðŸ“ƒ
### Formik is a small library that helps you with the 3 most annoying parts:

1. Getting values in and out of form state
2. Validation and error messages
3. Handling form submission

By colocating all of the above in one place, Formik will keep things organized--making testing, refactoring, and reasoning about your forms a breeze. ðŸŒ¿ðŸŒ¸
